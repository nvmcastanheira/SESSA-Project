Values calculated with the TPP-2M formula to estimate the inelastic mean free path.

 The differential elastic scattering cross sections were obtained from the relativistic partial-wave expansion method applied to electrons scattered by the static Dirac-Hartree-Fock potential.

 calculation based on program HFS by Herman-Skillman-Kortum-Yeh, REV 1983  that gives the hartree fock slater wave functions  (see atomic structure calculation by Herman and Skillman) and program CRST by Manson-Goldberg-Yeh REV 1983 that gives the cross section and asymmetry parameter.
